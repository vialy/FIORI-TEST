### Proposal

How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey.

### Permissions and Security

What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

### Documentation

Link to the functional specification document and copy the necessary information in this ticket. As this will avoid discussions later on (traceability!).

### Testing

Provide sufficient test-cases for the developers **before** the development starts.

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.
